This program generates an array list of 100 integers ranging from 0 to 100, then sorts them in order with a merge sort method. It shuffles the same array, then uses a quick sort method to sort it again. While this is happening, the program tracks the time the sorting methods took to complete the sort, compares them, then tells the user which sorting method was the fastest for that instance.
